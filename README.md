Used CIFAR10 dataset for dataset2 and merged it with the original dataset Synthetic Pepe.
Chose only frog images for merging with original dataset.
Loaded them both and transformed into 32x32 images, also converted the dataset that was a dict into tuple for ease of access. Created a simple CNN model and trained for 15 epochs. Got final accuracy of 92%.
Used chatgpt to fix some of the errors.
